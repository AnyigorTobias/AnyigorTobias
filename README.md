# Welcome 👋

I am Tobias Anyigor, a budding research-focused tech-guy with a growing interest in the application of AI/ML in solving real life problems, modelling and system design.
Naturally, I am analytical, curious and enjoy sharing ideas on areas of interest which includes technology, usecases, personal development and marketing of products or brands. With a background in STEM, I can readily understand the maths and statistics behind certain systems. You can check me out on LinkedIn @            or Twitter @
