# Welcome to my GithubðŸ‘‹

I am Anyigor Tobias. As of the time of writing this, I have a B.Eng. Degree in Chemical engineering and an unwavering interest in AI Products development. I started my journey to becoming a leading data professional with the popular MS Excel. As a trained Data Analyst Consultant, I utilize MS Excel, Python, mySQL, and Power BI to discover insights in data that answer business questions and deliver value. I teach newbies data analysis and also share my knowledge of tech tools with a community I am building. [Growth Segment](https://t.me/growthsegmentx) Telegram.
